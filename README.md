# 🧠 Data Science Portfolio 

Welcome to my personal collection of Data Science and Machine Learning projects. Each repository showcases a unique business problem, real-world data, and end-to-end solutions — from data wrangling and feature engineering to predictive modeling and deployment. This portfolio reflects my passion for solving complex problems using data.
